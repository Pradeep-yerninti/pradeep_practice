      <p class="para">I have learned Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) from Smart Interviews, which provided a strong foundation in core concepts. Through structured lessons and hands-on practice, I gained a deep understanding of how to approach and solve problems efficiently. I learned to analyze time and space complexity and apply optimal solutions using the right data structures and algorithms. The training also emphasized logical thinking, debugging skills, and real interview-style problem solving. I will use DSA to tackle complex programming challenges with confidence and clarity. Overall, DSA has enhanced my ability to think critically and solve problems systematically.</p>

RECOGNITION AND DIAGNOSIS</h1>

        <p class="para">ABSTRACT Cancer is a deadly disease that arises due to the growth of uncontrollable body cells. Every
year, a large number of people succumb to cancer and it’s been labeled as the most serious public health
snag. Cancer can develop in any part of the human anatomy, which may consist of trillions of cellules. One
of the most frequent type of cancer is skin cancer which develops in the upper layer of the skin. Previously,
machine learning techniques have been used for skin cancer detection using protein sequences and different
kinds of imaging modalities. The drawback of the machine learning approaches is that they require human-
engineered features, which is a very laborious and time-taking activity. Deep learning addressed this issue
to some extent by providing the facility of automatic feature extraction. In this study, convolution-based
deep neural networks have been used for skin cancer detection using ISIC public dataset. Cancer detection
is a sensitive issue, which is prone to errors if not timely and accurately detected. The performance of the
individual machine learning models to detect cancer is limited. The combined decision of individual learners
is expected to be more accurate than the individual learners. The ensemble learning technique exploits the
diversity of learners to yield a better decision. Thus, the prediction accuracy can be enhanced by combing
the decision of individual learners for sensitive issues such as cancer detection. In this paper, an ensemble
of deep learners has been developed using learners of VGG, CapsNet, and ResNet for skin cancer detection.
The results show that the combined decision of deep learners is superior to the finding of individual learners
in terms of sensitivity, accuracy, specificity, F-score, and precision. The experimental results of this study
provide a compelling reason to be applied for other disease detection.</p>
